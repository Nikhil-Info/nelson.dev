## Abstract

This paper presents a set of UI design patterns inspired by blockchain technology principles. These patterns help users understand system operations, verify data integrity, and build trust in web applications through enhanced transparency and auditability.

## Introduction

As web applications handle increasingly sensitive data and critical operations, user trust becomes paramount. Traditional UI patterns often obscure system operations, leaving users uncertain about data handling and system behavior.

## Design Patterns

We introduce four key patterns that significantly improve user trust and system understanding in modern web applications.

## User Studies

Our research demonstrates substantial improvements in trust perception and user confidence across multiple application domains.

## Conclusion

Blockchain-inspired UI patterns offer valuable tools for building more transparent and trustworthy web applications.
