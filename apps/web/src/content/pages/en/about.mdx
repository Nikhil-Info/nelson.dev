## MY JOURNEY

I'm a Full Stack Engineer who builds performant, scalable applications using TypeScript and Next.js. When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in strategic games-both share the same core principles: complex problem-solving, forward-thinking, and the satisfaction of executing a perfect plan.

My coding journey began on December 5, 2015, when I was just 17 years old. What started as a hobby has evolved into a passion, learning entirely through self-study on YouTube. Special shoutout to [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja)-his tutorials were instrumental in building my foundation in web development.

I've built my workflow around modern tools I love: crafting experiences with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), collaborating and versioning with [GitHub](https://github.com), and seamlessly deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
